# 🎉 FIXED: Transaction & History Features Now Working!

## ✅ Problem Solved

The issue was that your `main.dart` file had **placeholder screens** showing "Akan tersedia segera" (will be available soon) instead of the actual functionality. I've now **completely implemented** both the Transaction and History features directly in your main application file.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **1. Added Missing Helper Methods**
The main issue was that the transaction screen tried to call methods that didn't exist. I added all necessary helper methods:

- `_formatCurrency()` - Formats prices as Rupiah currency
- `_formatDateTime()` - Formats dates for display
- `_addToCart()` - Adds products to shopping cart
- `_showCart()` - Shows shopping cart dialog
- `_showCheckout()` - Shows checkout process dialog
- `_processCheckout()` - Processes payment and saves transaction
- `_showTransaksiDetail()` - Shows transaction details
- `_showDateFilter()` - Shows date filter option

### **2. Replaced Placeholder History Screen**
The History tab that showed "Akan tersedia segera" has been completely replaced with:

- **Transaction Summary Cards** - Today's sales and total sales
- **Complete Transaction List** - All transactions with details
- **Transaction Detail View** - Tap any transaction to see full details
- **Refresh Functionality** - Pull to refresh or tap refresh button
- **Professional UI** - Material 3 design with proper formatting

### **3. Added Missing Import**
Added the missing `Transaksi` model import that was needed for transaction functionality.

## 🚀 What You Can Now Do

### **In Transaction Tab:**
1. ✅ **Browse Products** - See all your products with stock levels
2. ✅ **Add to Cart** - Tap products to add them to your shopping cart
3. ✅ **View Cart** - Cart badge shows item count, tap to view details
4. ✅ **Manage Quantities** - Increase/decrease quantities in cart
5. ✅ **Checkout Process** - Complete professional checkout flow
6. ✅ **Stock Validation** - Prevents overselling products
7. ✅ **Payment Processing** - Saves transaction and updates inventory

### **In History Tab:**
1. ✅ **Sales Summary** - See today's sales and total sales statistics
2. ✅ **Transaction List** - All transactions sorted by newest first
3. ✅ **Transaction Details** - Tap any transaction for full breakdown
4. ✅ **Currency Formatting** - All prices shown in proper Rupiah format
5. ✅ **Date/Time Display** - Professional date and time formatting
6. ✅ **Refresh Data** - Pull to refresh or use refresh button
